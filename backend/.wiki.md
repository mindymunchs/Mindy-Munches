# Project Summary
The Mindy Munchs project is developing a comprehensive backend for an e-commerce platform that utilizes Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This backend will support functionalities such as user authentication, product management, shopping cart operations, and order processing. The goal is to create a seamless integration with the existing frontend, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

# Project Module Description
- **User Authentication**: Implements JWT-based authentication, allowing user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Product Management**: Facilitates CRUD operations for products, including search and filtering by categories.
- **Shopping Cart**: Manages user-selected products, allowing addition, removal, and quantity updates.
- **Order Processing**: Handles order creation, tracking, and management, with functionalities for both users and administrators.
- **Admin Panel Support**: Provides features for user role management and analytics.

# Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install required packages.
2. **Build**: No specific build steps are required as this is a Node.js application.
3. **Environment Configuration**: 
   - Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
   - Update the `.env` file with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret.
4. **Start MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use MongoDB Atlas.
5. **Seed Sample Data (optional)**: Run `npm run seed` to populate the database with initial data.
6. **Run the Application**: Execute `npm run dev` for development mode or `npm start` for production mode.
